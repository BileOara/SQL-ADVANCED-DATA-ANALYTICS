# SQL-ADVANCED-DATA-ANALYTICS

## A collection of SQL analytics scripts prepared from the data warehouse built in my previous project, designed for exploration, reporting, and insights



### The scripts cover a variety of analytical use cases, including:

- Database exploration – understanding schema structures, relationships, and data distributions

- Measures & metrics – calculating KPIs, ratios, and performance indicators

- Time-based trends – analyzing historical patterns, growth rates, and seasonality

- Cumulative analytics – building rolling sums, moving averages, and running totals

- Segmentation – slicing data by categories, cohorts, or dimensions for deeper insights

- Advanced analyses – combining multiple techniques to answer complex business questions

### Each script is:

- Focused on a specific analytical theme for clarity and reusability

- Written with SQL best practices, including clear formatting and comments

- Adaptable to multiple SQL dialects, making it easy to customize for your database environment
